  "code": "Certainly! Here's a Python function that uses a regular expression to validate email addresses. The regex pattern adheres to common standards for email validation, but keep in mind that completely accurate email validation can be complex due to the wide variety of valid email formats. This implementation targets most typical cases.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates an email address using regex.\n    \n    Args:\n        email (str): The email address to validate.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a regex pattern for validating email addresses\n    email_regex = re.compile(\n        r\"^(?P<local>[^@]+)@(?P<domain>[^@]+\\.[^@]+)$\"\n    )\n\n    # Match the email against the regex pattern\n    match = email_regex.match(email)\n    \n    if not match:\n        return False\n\n    local_part = match.group('local')\n    domain_part = match.group('domain')\n\n    # Additional checks (optional): validate local and domain parts\n    # For more thorough validation, you could expand this as needed\n    \n    # Check local part length\n    if len(local_part) > 64:\n        return False\n\n    # Check domain part length\n    if len(domain_part) > 255:\n        return False\n\n    # Basic checks passed\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_emails = [\n        \"example@example.com\",\n        \"invalid@@example.com\",\n        \"user.name+tag+sorting@example.co.uk\",\n        \"user@localserver\",\n        \"user@.com\",\n        \"user@sub.domain.com\",\n        \"user@domain.com.\",\n        \"user@domain..com\",\n        \"user@domain.com\"\n    ]\n\n    for email in test_emails:\n        print(f\"{email}: {is_valid_email(email)}\")\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- The regex pattern used here is simplified for clarity and common use cases.\n- For production-grade email validation, consider using dedicated libraries like `email_validator`.\n- Be cautious with user input; while regex reduces obvious invalid emails, it doesn't cover every edge case per RFC standards.\n- This function performs some additional length checks, which are part of common validation constraints.\n\nWould you like a more strict validation approach or integration with email verification services?",
